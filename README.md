MassWdOps
==========================

MassWdOps or WikidataBot is very much experimental. I haven't even decided on a name yet ðŸ˜‰
Things might collapse on your head at any point when trying to use this code without thinking ðŸ˜‰

The bot is based on WikployLite.
If you want something stable you might want to have a look at [Wikiploy/WikiployLite](https://github.com/Eccenux/Wikiploy).
